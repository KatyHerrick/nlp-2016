## Running
```sh
$ python regex_dollar.py ; python regex_phone.py
```
No arguments are needed. Output files will be written automatically.

## To Make It Better
* Figure out a better tool than `re.findall()` to return all search results of the regex.
* When optional subexpressions are found (i.e. expressions in parentheses are followed by a counting operator such as *, +, or ?), figure out how to format the results as something other than a tuple.
